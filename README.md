# Ventas

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.



## Development

Run `npm install --save rxjs-compat` This command will install a package that ensures backward-compatibility of RxJS. Even though the rxjs package itself would not work with your current code, with the addition of rxjs-compatit will.
Behind the scenes, rxjs still supports your old import statements and operator usage but it only does so if it can find the rxjs-compat package in the same project.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

console.log('good look')
